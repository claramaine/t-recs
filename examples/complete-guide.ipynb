It introduces the simplest ways to get started with the simulator, and it dives into more advanced concepts that will allow you to get a sense of the flexibility of the system.

    "A simulation needs the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Users**: agents who interact with each other and with items.\n",
    "- **Model**: agent that defines the behavior of the sociotechnical system. The model mediates the interactions among users and between users and the system.\n",
    "- **Items**: passive components that are served to the users by the model. (Items may come from a fixed catalog or may be dynamically generated by **creators**.)\n",
    "- **Measurements**: modules built into the models which automatically compute information about the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamics\n",
    "The following steps are at the heart of the simulations:\n",
    "1. The **model** presents the **users** with some recommended **items**. The recommendations are generated in accordance with the specific recommender system algorithm the model is using (e.g., content filtering, popularity, etc.). The input to the algorithm is based on the model's _prediction_ or _knowledge_ of user preferences.\n",
    "2. The **users** view the items presented by the **model**, and interact with some **items** according to some _actual_ preferences.\n",
    "3. The **model** updates its system state (such as the prediction of user preferences) based on the interactions of **users** with **items**, and it takes some **measurements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that this framework is very flexible and it can be a generalization of many classic and new models."

    "The Users class also determines how users interact with items. The default behavior is defined in [get_user_feedback()](https://elucherini.github.io/t-recs/reference/components.html#components.users.Users.get_user_feedback). In short, when the system presents items to users, users internally evaluate the items and choose the one item that maximizes the dot product between their own preferences and the item attributes. This default behavior can be overriden to provide a custom model of user-item interaction (for an example, see [DNUsers](https://elucherini.github.io/t-recs/reference/components.html#components.users.DNUsers)).\n",

Specifically, models determine the number of items to present users at each iteraction through parameter `num_items_per_iter`. The default is 10 items per user per iteration."
