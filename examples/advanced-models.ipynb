    "# Create your own models\n",
    "This Notebook illustrates how to create your own models using the framework. At the end of this guide, you'll be able to run simulations with your own models. For a guide on how to create new metrics, please see [advanced-metrics](advanced-metrics.ipynb). In what follows, we assume you are familiar with the main concepts of the framework shown in [complete-guide](complete-guide.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamics\n",
    "Recall that the dynamics of the framework are expressed by the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. The **model** presents the **users** with some recommended **items**. In general, the items are chosen such that they maximize the probability of user engangement. This probability is based on the model's _prediction_ of user preferences.\n",
    "> 2. The **users** view the items presented by the **model**, and interact with some **items** according to some _actual_ preferences.\n",
    "> 3. The **model** updates its system state (such as the prediction of user preferences) based on the interactions of **users** with **items**, and it takes some **measurements**."

    "\n",
    "### `__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The constructor must initialize a number of data structures to pass to the parent constructor. Importantly, it must initialize:\n",
    "    - An array of user preferences as predicted by the system (`user_representation`)\n",
    "    - An array of item attributes in the system (`item_representation`)\n",
    "    - ~~A representation of real user preferences, which will not be used by to the system to make predictions (`actual_user_representation`)~~ (will fix asap)\n",
    "    - The number of users in the system (`num_users`)\n",
    "    - The number of items in the system (`num_items`)\n",
    "    - The number of items presented to each user at each time step (`num_items_per_iter`)\n",
    "    - (Optional) The metrics that the system should monitor (`measurements`)\n",
    "    - (Optional) A list of system state components to monitor in addition to the \"Observables\" already present in the system (`system_state` see [advanced-metrics](advanced-metrics.ipynb) for more details)\n",
    "    - (Optional) A bool to toggle a log of the main events in the system (`verbose`)\n",
    "    - (Optional) A seed for random number generators (`seed`)\n",
    " \n",
    "2. The constructor must also initialize any class attribute that is _not_ already being initialized by `BaseRecommender`. `BaseRecommender` initializes (see [docs](https://elucherini.github.io/algo-segregation/reference/models.html#module-models.recommender) and code for more details):\n",
    "    - `user_profiles`, from `user_representation`\n",
    "    - `item_attributes`, from `item_representation`\n",
    "    - `predicted_scores`, calculated internally\n",
    "    - `actual_users`, drawn randomly internally for the moment -- later from `actual_user_representation`\n",
    "    - `num_users`, from `num_users`\n",
    "    - `num_items`, from `num_items`\n",
    "    - `num_items_per_iter`, from `num_items_per_iter`\n",
    "    - `random_state`, using `seed`\n",
    "    - `measurements`, monitoring all metrics in `measurements`, and, by default, the MSE between user profile predictions and actual user scores\n",
    "    - `_system_state`, monitoring all \"Observables\" in `system_state`, and, by default: `user_profiles`, `item_attributes`, `predicted_scores`, and `actual_users`.\n",
    "    - `verbose`, from `verbose`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Any other class attribute (e.g., [infection state](https://elucherini.github.io/algo-segregation/reference/models.html#models.bass.InfectionState)) must be inizialized by `NewModel`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. A current requirement is that `user_representation` and `item_representation` be of compatible size for dot products (e.g., `num_users x 1` and `1 x num_items`, respectively). This requirement is necessary to use the `train()` function in `BaseRecommender` -- which can be easily overridden if needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The constructor must then call the `BaseRecommender` constructor respecting its signature.\n",
